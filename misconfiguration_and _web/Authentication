Username enumeration:
1) Status codes
   If a guess returns a different status code, this is a strong indication that the username was correct.
2) Error messages
  Sometimes the returned error message is different depending on whether both the username AND password are 
  incorrect or only the password was incorrect. 
3) Response times
   Some websites might only check whether the password is correct if the username is valid. 
   This extra step might cause a slight increase in the response time. This may be subtle, 
   but an attacker can make this delay more obvious by entering an excessively long password that the
   website takes noticeably longer to handle.

Two-factor:
If the user is first prompted to enter a password, and then prompted to enter a verification code on a separate page,
the user is effectively in a "logged in" state before they have entered the verification code.
In this case, it is worth testing to see if you can directly skip to "logged-in only" pages after completing the 
first authentication step. 

bypassing brute-force protection:
 1)Changing IP origin using headers:
    X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1
    X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
    X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1
    X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1
    X-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1
    X-Host: 127.0.0.1
    X-Forwared-Host: 127.0.0.1
 2) login counter reset
    somtimes entering valid credentials can reset the brute-force protection count
