Unattended Windows Installations:
installations require the use of an administrator account to perform the initial setup, 
which might end up being stored in the machine in the following locations:
1. C:\Unattend.xml
2. C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
3. C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\Unattend.xml
4. C:\Windows\system32\sysprep.inf
5. C:\Windows\system32\sysprep\sysprep.xml

Powershell History:
Whenever a user runs a command using Powershell, it gets stored into a file that keeps a memory of past commands. 
If a user runs a command that includes a password directly as part of the Powershell command line,
it can later be retrieved by using the following command from a cmd.exe prompt:
1. type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt
The command above will only work from cmd.exe, as Powershell won't recognize %userprofile% as an environment variable.

Saved Windows Credentials:
Windows allows us to use other users' credentials. This function also gives the option to save these credentials on the system.
The command below will list saved credentials:
1. cmdkey /list 
While you can't see the actual passwords, if you notice any credentials worth trying, you can use to run cmd as them:
runas /savecred /user:admin cmd.exe

IIS Configuration:
The configuration of websites on IIS is stored in a file called web.config and can store
passwords for databases or configured authentication mechanisms. Depending on the installed version of IIS,
we can find web.config in one of the following locations:
1. C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
2. C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config
Here is a quick way to find database connection strings on the file:
3. type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString

Retrieve Credentials from Software: PuTTY:
PuTTY is an SSH client commonly found on Windows systems. nstead of having to specify a connection's parameters every single time,
users can store sessions where the IP, user and other configurations can be stored for later use.
While PuTTY won't allow users to store their SSH password, it will store proxy configurations that include cleartext authentication credentials.
To retrieve the stored proxy credentials, you can search under the following registry key for ProxyPassword with the following command:
1. reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f "Proxy" /s
