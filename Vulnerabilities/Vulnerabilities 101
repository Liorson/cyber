Scoring Vulnerabilities:
1) CVSS  - open source framework for vulnerability scoring by the following factors:
  *) How easy is it to exploit the vulnerability?
  *) Do exploits exist for this?
  *) How does this vulnerability interfere with the CIA triad?
2) vpr   - modern framework in vulnerability management
  *) vulnerabilities are given a score with a heavy focus on the risk a vulnerability poses to the organisation itself
