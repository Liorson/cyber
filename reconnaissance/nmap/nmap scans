targets behind stateless firewall scan:
Null Scan
FIN Scan
Xmas Scan
explanation- One scenario where these three scan types can be efficient is when 
scanning a target behind a stateless (non-stateful) firewall. A stateless firewall 
will check if the incoming packet has the SYN flag set to detect a connection attempt. 
Using a flag combination that does not match the SYN packet makes it possible to deceive the
firewall and reach the system behind it. However, a stateful firewall will practically block all 
such crafted packets and render this kind of scan useless.
