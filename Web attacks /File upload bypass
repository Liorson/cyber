1) validation of file uploads -
"Content-Type: image/jpeg"
when expecting only images the content type will be as follows "Content-Type: image/jpeg".
when we upload a php file, the content type will be "Content-Type: application/x-httpd-php" so all we need to change between
the unexpected php and the expected jpeg.

2) Web shell upload via path traversal -
there is an option to disable some directories from executing files like Images directory.
so we can upload our file with file traversal to another directory which is less secure and run it from there
*Web servers often use the filename field in multipart/form-data requests to determine the name and location 
where the file should be saved.*:
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="../test.php"

3) Web shell upload via extension blacklist bypass -
One of the more obvious ways of preventing users from uploading malicious scripts is to blacklist potentially 
dangerous file extensions like .php. The practice of blacklisting is inherently flawed as it's difficult to explicitly
block every possible file extension that could be used to execute code. Such blacklists can sometimes be bypassed by 
using lesser-known, alternative file extensions that may still be executable, such as .php5, .shtml, and so on.
Overriding the server configuration:
before an Apache server will execute PHP files requested by a client, developers might have to add the following
directives to their /etc/apache2/apache2.conf file:
LoadModule php_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp.so
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
Apache servers, for example, will load a directory-specific configuration from a file called .htaccess if one is present.
IIS servers using a web.config file. 

4) Web shell upload via obfuscated file extension (when dealing with whitelist) -
 a)provide an extension of case mix like "test.pHp
 b)provide multiple extensions like "exploit.php.jpg"
 c)provide an extension with URL encoding (or double URL encoding) for dots, forward slashes , backward slashes "exploit%2Ephp"
 d)provide semicolons or URL-encoded null byte characters before the file extension like "exploit.asp;.jpg" "exploit.asp%00.jpg"
 e)Try using multibyte unicode characters, which may be converted to null bytes and dots after unicode conversion or 
   normalization. Sequences like xC0 x2E, xC4 xAE or xC0 xAE may be translated to x2E
 f)provide double the extension like "exploit.p.phphp" for defenses that involve stripping or replacing dangerous extensions
